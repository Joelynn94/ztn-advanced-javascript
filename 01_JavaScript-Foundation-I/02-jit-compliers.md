# JIT Compilers and Profilers

## JIT Compilers

Just-In-Time (JIT) compilers compile code during program execution, offering several benefits in JavaScript:

- **Dynamic Typing**: JIT compilers optimize code based on actual runtime types, accommodating JavaScript's dynamic typing.
- **Code Reuse**: JIT compilers optimize functions that are frequently called with the same argument types, enhancing performance on subsequent calls.

## Profilers

Profilers are tools for performance analysis, measuring program behavior to identify optimization opportunities:

- **Performance Analysis**: Profilers highlight resource-intensive parts of a program, helping developers prioritize optimization efforts.
- **Code Optimization**: Profilers identify bottlenecks, guiding code optimization for faster execution and lower resource consumption.
- **Runtime Analysis**: Profilers operate at runtime, collecting performance data as the program runs.
- **Types of Profiling**: Profiling types include CPU, memory, and thread profiling, each focusing on a different performance aspect.
