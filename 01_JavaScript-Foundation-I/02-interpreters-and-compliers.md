# Interpreters and Compilers

## Interpreters

Interpreters translate programs into machine code line by line. With just-in-time compilation, the speed of interpreted languages has significantly improved. Examples include PHP, Ruby, Python, and JavaScript.

## Compilers

Compilers convert languages directly into machine code, resulting in faster and more efficient execution. They also provide more control over hardware aspects like memory management and CPU usage. Examples include C, C++, Erlang, Haskell, Rust, and Go.

## Babel

Babel is a JavaScript compiler that transforms modern JS code into older, browser-compatible JS code.

## TypeScript

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that compiles down to JavaScript. Both Babel and TypeScript are examples of compilers as they convert one language into another.
