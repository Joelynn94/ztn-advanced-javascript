# JavaScript History

JavaScript, created by Brendan Eich in 1995, requires an engine to interpret its code for computers. Eich, while working at Netscape, also built the first JavaScript engine, SpiderMonkey.

JavaScript was initially created to make web pages more interactive. It was first named Mocha, then LiveScript, and finally JavaScript.

In 1997, JavaScript was standardized by the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) and became ECMAScript. This standardization has led to the development of other languages that compile to JavaScript, such as TypeScript and CoffeeScript.

Later, in 2008, Google's Lars Bak created the V8 JavaScript engine, which is used in Google Chrome and is known for its speed. The creation of V8 also led to the development of Node.js, a runtime that allows JavaScript to be used outside of the browser.

JavaScript has evolved significantly since its creation and is now used for complex web applications, server-side programming, and even mobile app development.
