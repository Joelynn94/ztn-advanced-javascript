## Global Variables

Global variables are accessible from any part of the code, which can lead to several issues:

1. **Naming Conflicts**: Too many global variables can lead to accidental naming conflicts, causing unexpected behavior.

2. **Code Maintainability**: Since global variables can be modified from anywhere, it can be difficult to track where changes are coming from, making the code harder to understand and debug.

3. **Memory Usage**: Global variables persist for the lifetime of the application, potentially leading to increased memory usage.

Therefore, it's recommended to limit the use of global variables as much as possible.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Accidental Global Variables**: One of the most common mistakes in JavaScript is accidentally creating global variables, for example by forgetting to use the `var`, `let`, or `const` keyword when declaring a variable.

2. **Overuse of Global Variables**: Overusing global variables can lead to naming conflicts and make your code harder to understand and maintain.

3. **Modifying Global Variables**: Modifying global variables from different parts of your code can lead to unexpected behavior and make debugging difficult.

## Best Practices

1. **Minimize Use of Global Variables**: Try to keep the number of global variables to a minimum. Use local variables, function parameters, or object properties instead.

2. **Use `const` for Constants**: If you have a value that won't change, declare it as a global constant using the `const` keyword. This makes your intention clear and prevents accidental modification.

3. **Namespace Your Code**: If you need to use multiple global variables, consider using a single global object as a namespace. This can help avoid naming conflicts.
